### Installation:
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

### Motivation:
According to **Snapshot of Tony Pino's Melbourne Housing Dataset in 2017** to have a look at Melbourne real estate history records. For anyone like me who want to stay and live long term in Melbourne, owning a property could be a essential move to consider. Researching and studying real estate history could help to understand the trend of market, also it could provide me insights from data which might be valueable.

### Notebooks:
There is **3 main questions** for my notebooks: each main questions have several sub questions for my findings.
1. **Understand the area distribution and pattern** - checking which area has more traded records.
2. **According to question 1 to analysis property types distribution** - which type of property has more records.
3. **Based on my own requirement to find out and recommend myself wwhich area I should consider**.

### Results:
All the finding can be found on this post.
