### Installation:
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

### Motivation:
According to **Snapshot of Tony Pino's Melbourne Housing Dataset in 2017** to have a look at Melbourne real estate history records. For anyone like me who want to stay and live long term in Melbourne, owning a property could be a essential move to consider.

### Notebooks:
There is **3 main questions** for my notebooks: each main questions have several sub questions for my findings.
1. [**Understand the area distribution and pattern**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/yayuchen/melbourne_housing/blob/main/Area_distribution.ipynb#2) - checking which area has more traded records.
2. [**According to question 1 to analysis property types distribution**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/yayuchen/melbourne_housing/blob/main/Property_TYPE.ipynb#1) - which type of property has more records.
3. [**Based on my own requirement to find out and recommend myself which area I should consider**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/yayuchen/melbourne_housing/blob/main/Recommend.ipynb).

### Results:
Question 1 - For those area which had traded frequency, the average property price is lower. On the other hand, less frequency area has higher average price.
